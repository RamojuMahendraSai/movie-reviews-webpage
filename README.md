Movie Reviews Webpage ðŸŽ¬

This is a simple web app I built to explore how a modern frontend stack can be used to display and organize movie reviews. The main idea is to give a clean and interactive way to browse movies, check their ratings, and read short summaries.

What It Does

Shows a collection of movies in a neat layout

Lets you explore reviews, ratings, and details

Designed to be simple, responsive, and easy to extend

Tech Behind It

React for building the interface

TypeScript for cleaner and safer code

Vite to keep development fast and smooth

Tailwind CSS for styling and layouts

Future Ideas

Some features Iâ€™d like to add later:

A real backend so users can add their own reviews

Login and signup for personalization

Filters like rating, genre, or release year

Dark mode support

Why I Built This

Mainly to practice and learn â€” but also because movie reviews are fun to work with. Itâ€™s a small step toward building bigger, real-world web applications.
